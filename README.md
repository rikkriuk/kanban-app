# Kanban Board UI
A simple Kanban Board UI built with React.js, Vite, and DaisyUI. This project focuses on creating a visually appealing interface for task management with columns for Backlog, On Progress, and Done tasks. It includes a modal for adding new tasks using CKEditor 5.
## Features
- Kanban Board with three columns:
    - Backlog
    - On Progress
    - Done
- Task Modal for adding tasks with:
- Title
    - Description (using CKEditor 5)
    - Start Date and End Date
    - Task Type (Development, Testing, Design)
- Responsive Design using DaisyUI and TailwindCSS.
## Technologies Used
- React.js: For building the user interface.
- Vite: As the build tool for fast development.
- DaisyUI: For pre-styled and customizable UI components.
- TailwindCSS: For utility-first CSS styling.
- CKEditor 5: For rich text editing in the task description.
